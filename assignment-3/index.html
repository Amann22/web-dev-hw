    <h3>  An instructional guide on how to hand craft the most delectable pesto sauce on the market.</h3>
        <blockquote><pre>
          Every year we plant basil and every year the plants do so well that
          we canâ€™t use it up fast enough. What to do? Basil pesto, of course!
          Here is a simple recipe. Note that pesto is always made to taste, based
          on the ingredients at hand. So adjust the ingredients to your taste.

          <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>1/3 cup pine nuts (can sub chopped walnuts)</li>
          <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (about 3 teaspoons)</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, more to taste</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
      <h3> Equipment Needed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Food Procesor</li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Preparation Directions</h2>
        <ol><pre>
            <li>
              <strong>Pulse basil and pine nuts in a food processor:</strong> Place the basil
              leaves and pine nuts into the bowl of a food processor and pulse a
              several times.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add the garlic and cheese:</strong> Add the garlic and Parmesan or Romano
              cheese and pulse several times more. Scrape down the sides of the
              food processor with a rubber spatula.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stream in the olive oil:</strong> While the food processor is running,
              slowly add the olive oil in a steady small stream. Adding the olive
              oil slowly, while the processor is running, will help it emulsify
              and help keep the olive oil from separating. Occasionally stop to
              scrape down the sides of the food processor.</li>
            <li>
              Stir in salt and freshly ground black pepper, add more to taste.</li>
            <li>
              Toss with pasta for a quick sauce, dollop over baked potatoes,
              or spread onto crackers or toasted slices of bread. Enjoy!!</li>
