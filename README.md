# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Aidan Mann
I have decided to take this class not only because it is a credit requirement for my minor but because an understanding of web design is very valuable to me as an artist. In the way that the world is currently moving any further understanding of the way the web works is a step up. Not only will this class give me the ability to create a website but it gives me a place to explore and expand from.

* I found it very interesting that the web began as a a defense department project called the arpanet, also the use of the web design was to allow it to function after a nuclear attack
* The internet is only about 25 years old!?!
* Did not know that there were undersea cables that connected the oversea countries to our network
