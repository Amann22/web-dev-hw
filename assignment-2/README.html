<p>
  Git and Github used what is called a version Control System. This is a system
  that records changes and edits as you work. This allows one to look through
  changes and progress whenever you want, it also allows the user to go back
  however far if a mistake is made or the wrong path is taken. With big project
  such as in this class, a version Control System is perfect because it is never
  bad to add or make a change because you can always go back and recover what you
  had.
